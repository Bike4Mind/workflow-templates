/**
 * Guard: how a `bot-fold` run is allowed to write to a PR branch.
 *
 * The review agent in `pr-bot-review.yml` reads untrusted PR, issue and comment text on a
 * public repo, so it deliberately has no shell. Fold mode widens it to the file-write tools
 * so it can apply its own findings - and that is the whole of the widening. Deciding WHAT to
 * change stays with the agent; making the change durable is a plain `run:` step, which is what
 * keeps the destination ref, the force-push choice and the set of paths a fold may touch out of
 * the agent's reach as a matter of construction rather than of prose.
 *
 * Nothing else can catch a regression here. The fold path cannot be exercised before a change
 * to this file merges: claude-code-action validates the calling workflow against the
 * DEFAULT-BRANCH copy and no-ops with a successful exit when they differ, so labelling the PR
 * that edits it does nothing and labelling any other PR runs main's copy. A fold run is also
 * expensive and mutates a branch, so it is not something CI can rehearse. These assertions are
 * the only pre-merge evidence the invariants still hold, so they pin the antecedent (`FOLD_MODE`
 * itself) as well as the consequents.
 *
 * Scope is deliberate and not uniform. A gate or a tool list is a property of the step it sits
 * on, so those are pinned step-scoped; an invariant stated as "a fold cannot push X" or "this job
 * does not execute checkout bytes" is a property of the FILE, so `gitPushes`, `gitSubcommands`,
 * `invokedPrograms`, `checkoutCodeReferences`, `runnerFileWrites`, `stepNames` and the
 * post-agent git-config sweep all read every `run:` body. A step-scoped assertion over one of
 * those is the shape that has been defeated repeatedly: it makes the bound a property of a NAME,
 * and any second step doing the same thing is invisible.
 *
 * Where a control is an executable shell fragment it is EXTRACTED FROM THE COMMITTED YAML AND
 * RUN, not pattern-matched. An earlier version of this file asserted only that the guard's text
 * was present, which left `grep -v -E`, a dropped `--cached` and an appended `CHANGED=0` all
 * passing - each of which disarms the guard completely while every literal it named survived.
 * Text matching is still used for the declarative parts (tool lists, `if:` gates, step `env:`),
 * matching the sibling guards: the repo carries no YAML parser dependency and adding one for a
 * workflow assertion is not worth the supply chain.

 * Runs the WHOLE `Push fold commit` body, lifted verbatim out of the committed YAML, against a
 * scratch repo with a real bare remote, and reports the END STATE: exit status, every value the
 * step claimed for `pushed`, and what the remote ended up holding.
 *
 * Why the whole body and not the guard region `runStagedGuards` lifts. Every other assertion
 * over this step is either a pattern over its text or an execution of the two bounds in the
 * middle of it, which left the relationship between what the step REPORTS and what it DOES
 * asserted nowhere - and that gap is a class, not an instance. Five one-line edits (`set +e`, a
 * `trap 'exit 0' ERR`, wrapping the body in a subshell, `emit false || exit 1`, moving the
 * success `exit 0` into an `else`) each reach the exact "reported success, pushed nothing" end
 * state the step's own comment says `-e` prevents. And a staging route composed entirely of
 * subcommands the allowlist already permits - a redirection writing a `git show` into
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in the WORKING TREE, then `commit -a` - puts CI configuration on
 * the branch while the path guard, which reads the INDEX, correctly saw only the tracked edit.
 * None of that is visible to a matcher over the file; all of it is visible here.
 *
 * The one thing not real is the network: a `git` shim on PATH swaps the
 * `https://...@github.com/...` argument for the scratch bare repo and execs the real git with
 * every other argument untouched. So the add, both bounds, the commit, the refspec, the absence
 * of --force and the failure classifier are all shipped bytes running under real git.
